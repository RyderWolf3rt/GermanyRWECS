        </h2>
        <h3>
            The area that is now Germany was inhabited by Germanic speaking tribes for many centuries. <br>
             They first became part of the Frankish Empire under the rule of Charlemagne, <br>
             who is considered the father of the German monarchy. <br>
              Much of Germany also became part of the Holy Roman Empire. <br>
